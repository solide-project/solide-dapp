        "Ronin, an EVM blockchain designed for gaming, introduces technical aspects that distinguish it in the blockchain space. Initially utilizing Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus, Ronin enhanced decentralization by integrating Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). In DPoS, anyone holding sufficient RON can become a validator, contributing to transaction verification, block production, and earning rewards. Token holders can delegate their stake to validators, with higher-staked validators having increased chances of selection. The implementation of slashing rules penalizes malicious behavior, ensuring accountability among validators. Ronin's shift to DPoS maintains the advantages of PoA, such as swift transaction speeds and low fees, while addressing concerns about centralization through a more inclusive validator selection process. The technical evolution aligns with Ronin's commitment to optimizing blockchain functionality for gaming applications.",
