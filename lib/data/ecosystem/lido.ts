        "LIDO is a decentralized protocol that enables users to stake their assets in proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and receive tokenized representations (e.g., stETH) in return. This approach provides liquidity to staked assets, allowing users to earn staking rewards while maintaining flexibility to use their tokens in DeFi applications. LIDO operates as a staking pool governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), making PoS staking more accessible and flexible for a wider audience of blockchain users.",
