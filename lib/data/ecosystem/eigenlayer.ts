        "EigenLayer is an Ethereum-based protocol that introduces restaking as a novel approach to enhance cryptoeconomic security. Users can stake ETH directly or through a liquid staking token (LST) and opt into EigenLayer smart contracts to restake their assets, extending security to various Actively Validated Services (AVSs) on the network while earning additional rewards. EigenLayer enables Ethereum stakers to collectively secure multiple services by reusing their staked assets, reducing capital costs, and increasing trust guarantees for individual AVSs. By leveraging Ethereum's pooled security, EigenLayer eliminates the need for each decentralized service to establish its own trust network, promoting permissionless innovation and decentralized governance within the Web3 ecosystem.",
